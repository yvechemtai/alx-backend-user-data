# Project Name

## Description

This project is designed to provide a practical understanding of the authentication process and the implementation of Basic Authentication on a simple API. The focus is on learning the steps involved in Basic Authentication, although in real-world scenarios, it's recommended to use established modules or frameworks like Flask-HTTPAuth.

## Background Context

In this project, you will delve into the fundamentals of authentication, Base64 encoding, and the implementation of Basic Authentication on a Python Flask API. The goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of these concepts through hands-on tasks.

## Resources

- [REST API Authentication Mechanisms](#)
- [Base64 in Python](#)
- [HTTP header Authorization](#)
- [Flask](#)
- [Base64 - concept](#)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the concept of authentication.
- Understand Base64 encoding and decoding.
- Implement Basic Authentication on a Flask API.
- Use Flask to handle HTTP headers and routes.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7).
- Files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Code should follow the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5).
- All files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
- All modules, classes, and functions should have documentation.
